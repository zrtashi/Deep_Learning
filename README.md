# Binary Classification with PyTorch: Wildlife Camera Images

This repository contains a PyTorch-based binary classification model to identify whether a wildlife camera image contains a hog or not. The two image categories are:
- **Blank Images**: No hog present.
- **Hog Images**: Hog detected.

## **Project Summary**
In this lesson, we:
- Built neural network using PyTorch.
- Applied the model to classify wildlife camera images.
- Leveraged key deep learning techniques and PyTorch features for preprocessing, training, and saving the model.

## **Objectives**
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Convert images from grayscale to RGB.
   - Resize images for consistency.
   - Create a transformation pipeline to standardize images for training.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Built and trained a simple neural network in PyTorch.
   - Utilized **binary classification** to predict whether an image contains a hog.

3. **Saving the Model:**
   - Saved the trained neural network to disk for future use.

## **Key Terms and Concepts**
- **Activation Function:** Functions applied to transform the output of neurons (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
- **Automatic Differentiation:** Enables gradient calculation for optimization.
- **Backpropagation:** Algorithm to update weights based on error.
- **Binary Classification:** Distinguishing between two classes (Hog vs. Not Hog).
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** Loss function for classification tasks.
- **Epoch:** One complete pass through the training dataset.
- **Layers:** Building blocks of the neural network (input, hidden, output).
- **Logits:** Unnormalized outputs from the model.
- **Optimizer:** Algorithm to minimize loss (e.g., SGD, Adam).
